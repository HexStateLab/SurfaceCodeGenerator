pw_opt.py — Optimized share-pair circuit builder for (1+x²)(1+y²) code.

Key improvement: only 2 vertical-pair ancillas per 3-row column (p=0,1).
V(2,q) = V(0,q) ⊕ V(1,q) computed in software.
Saves 16 ancillas vs the standard share-pair layout (32 vs 48).

For 6×8: 48 data + 32 anc = 80 qubits, 64 CX, depth ~17, 0 SWAPs.

Optimizations in this revision (all output-format compatible):
  - compact=True (default): the QuantumRegister holds exactly the qubits
    actually used (data + measured ancillas + extras) instead of
    n_data + 2*r*s.  For 6×8 that is ~81 qubits instead of 145, which
    speeds up transpilation and simulation and removes idle wires.
    Set compact=False to restore the original register layout with
    heavy_hex_flag_layout indices.
  - Direction-major CX scheduling: all "self" CXs are emitted before all
    "+2 partner" CXs, so every extraction round is exactly 2 CX layers
    deep (4 for full_stabilizer) instead of chaining through shared data
    qubits.  All CXs within a round pairwise commute (data qubits are
    always on one side, ancillas on the other), so the unitary is
    unchanged — only the DAG depth improves (~2x per round).
  - initial_reset=False (default): the round-0 ancilla resets are dropped
    since qubits start in |0⟩; pass initial_reset=True to restore them.
  - share_extra_ancilla (opt-in): bell / bell_measure / ghz /
    ghz_measure can reuse a single extra qubit (reset between uses)
    instead of allocating one each.  Classical registers are unchanged.
  - Periodic Bell prep/measure skips the (0,0) qubit entirely: it appears
    in both X_L1 and X_L2, so the two CXs cancel (X² = I).  Saves 2 CX
    and 2 layers of ancilla depth per Bell operation.
  - all_syndromes_opt and verify_pipeline are fully vectorized
    (precomputed fancy-index unpacking, unique-syndrome decoding).
  - stabilizer_basis accepts repeating sequences ('ZX'/'XZ'): per-round
    alternating extraction of both stabilizer types, required to protect
    both correlators of a logical Bell state. Use with full_stabilizer=True
    (weight-4 S commute with both logicals; weight-2 V_Z gauge checks
    anticommute with X_L1X_L2 and dephase the Bell state in one round).
    Helpers round_bases / split_by_basis / detection_events handle the
    per-basis syndrome bookkeeping for decoding.

    periodic=True: periodic vertical boundary conditions — V(i,j) wraps
    i+2 modulo r, and V(r-2,j), V(r-1,j) reconstructed in software.
    periodic=False: open boundaries — V(i,j) = Z_i Z_{i+2,j} for i=0..r-3
    only; bottom two rows have no vertical stabilizers. X_L1 = col 0,
    X_L2 = col 2 (vertical strings) commute with all V(i,j), so Bell
    state survives multi-round QEC.

    stabilizer_basis='Z': measure V(i,j) = Z_i Z_{i+2,j} (Z⊗Z stabilizers) via data→anc CX.
    stabilizer_basis='X': measure V(i,j) = X_i X_{i+2,j} (X⊗X stabilizers) via anc→data CX
    with ancilla in |+⟩ (cleaner: 2 H per check on anc, not 4 on data).
    stabilizer_basis may also be a repeating sequence, e.g. 'ZX' or 'XZ':
    round t is measured in basis stabilizer_basis[t % len]. This is required
    to protect BOTH logical correlators of a Bell state simultaneously —
    Z-type checks alone leave dephasing uncorrected (X_L1X_L2 decays at the
    physical T2), and X-type alone leave bit flips uncorrected. Notes:
      - Use full_stabilizer=True with alternating bases for Bell states.
        The weight-4 S operators of both types commute with each other and
        with X_L1X_L2 and Z_L1Z_L2. The weight-2 V gauge operators do NOT:
        V_Z checks anticommute with X_L1X_L2 (periodic) and dephase the
        Bell state in one round even on perfect hardware.
      - no_reset differencing is basis-agnostic (the ancilla accumulates
        m_t = m_{t-1} ⊕ P_t whatever P_t is), so all_syndromes_opt needs
        no change; interpret even/odd rounds via round_bases() and form
        detection events with detection_events(), which differences
        consecutive SAME-basis rounds (a first-of-basis round is a random
        gauge-fixing reference unless the initial state is a deterministic
        eigenstate, e.g. |0…0⟩ for Z-type).
      - For logical_state prep (non-Bell), the |+⟩^N prep and flip operator
        follow the FIRST basis in the sequence.

    no_reset=True: skip ancilla resets on rounds > 0. Ancilla persists in |m_{r-1}⟩;
    CX flips by the new parity, so m_r = m_{r-1} ⊕ P_r. Recover P_r = m_r ⊕ m_{r-1}
    via consecutive differencing in all_syndromes_opt. Works in both Z and X bases.

    free_final_round=True: run rounds-1 ancilla rounds; the destructive data readout
    at the end supplies the last round's Z-stabilizer syndrome. Only valid when
    readout basis matches stabilizer basis (both Z or both X). Saves 64 CX.

    compact=True: allocate only the qubits actually used (data + measured
    ancillas + extras) and remap indices to a dense range. The returned
    data_map reflects the remapping. Set compact=False if downstream code
    relies on the raw heavy_hex_flag_layout indices (e.g. a trivial
    initial_layout onto physical qubits).

    initial_reset=False: skip the redundant round-0 ancilla resets
    (qubits initialize to |0⟩ on hardware and in Aer).

    share_extra_ancilla=True (opt-in, default False): bell/bell_measure/
    ghz/ghz_measure share one physical extra qubit, reset between uses.
    Saves qubits but serializes the parity chains (deeper circuit); only
    worth it when qubit count is the binding constraint. Classical output
    unchanged either way.

    For periodic r×s where both are even:
      - Sector (px, py): data at (2p+px, 2q+py) for p=0..r/2-1, q=0..s/2-1
      - In sector coords, V(p,q) = data[p][q] ⊕ data[(p+1)%(r/2)][q]
      - Measure V(p,q) for p=0..r/2-2 (all except last row in sector)
      - Compute V(r/2-1, q) = sum of all measured V(p,q) for p=0..r/2-2

    For r=6, s=8: sector size 3×4, measure p=0,1; compute p=2.

    parity_tree=None: optional plan from synthesize_parity_layout(backend,...).
    When given, the ancilla parity measurements (bell / bell_measure / ghz /
    ghz_measure — one op family per plan) are emitted as a cat state grown
    over a tree of physical qubits synthesized directly from the backend
    coupling map, instead of the single-ancilla degree-n star (which cannot
    embed on degree-3 heavy hex and forces ~300+ CZ of routing). Transpile
    with initial_layout=parity_tree['initial_layout'] and the whole circuit —
    QEC block and gadget — maps with zero SWAPs; the transpiled 2q count
    equals the logical CX count. Requires compact=True. Classical registers
    are unchanged (still one bit per parity op), so all_syndromes_opt and
    downstream analysis need no changes. Trade-off: more (but strictly
    nearest-neighbor, shallow, parallel) CXs ~ 2·|tree| + n instead of n
    long-routed ones; a Z fault on any tree qubit flips the recorded parity
    bit, an X fault during (un)growth walks out as a contiguous segment the
    checks can see.

    Why: the single-ancilla X⊗n gadget is a degree-n star — unembeddable on
    degree-3 heavy hex, so the transpiler routes it (~300+ CZ for n=12 on
    Heron). Fixed alternatives fail structurally: heavy hex has GIRTH 12,
    and any prescribed backbone that attaches to two data qubits of the same
    check-path closes a 10-cycle. The only shape guaranteed to embed is one
    read off the device itself: a cat state grown over a TREE that is a
    literal subgraph of the coupling map.

    Method: (1) VF2-embed the QEC block plus one pendant 'leaf' qubit per
    support data qubit (pendants add no cycles, so this pattern is
    girth-safe); (2) connect the leaf positions through remaining free
    physical qubits with a greedy Steiner tree; (3) return the tree
    structure and the full initial_layout.

    Usage:
        plan = synthesize_parity_layout(backend, 6, 8, op="bell",
                                        periodic=True)

        qc_t = pm.run(qc)   # transpiled 2q count == logical CX count

    op='bell' serves bell and bell_measure; op='ghz' serves ghz/ghz_measure
    (one op family per plan — their supports differ). The plan is
    JSON-serializable; synthesize once per backend and cache it.

    Notes: valid for the weight-2 (share-pair) extraction graph. The
    full_stabilizer=True graph has degree-4 check ancillas and does not
    embed on heavy hex at all — its layout is routed by the transpiler,
    and this plan does not apply there.
